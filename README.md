# KittenAssignment

'Create a vote tracker' assignment for Code 201.

Program randomly selects two images the user can vote on.
Highlights chosen photo, adds vote to counter and displays
chart to show relation of the chosen photo to votes of other photos.

Allows user to get two new randomly selected photos and vote again.
User must get new photos to vote again (cannot vote on same photo more than once
without getting new photos first).

Used flexbox for layout.

Incorporated jquery in where it seemed appropriate.

Credit to Chart.js for charting.
Credit to cssfontstack.com for font family selection.
Credit to Adobe Color CC for color scheme.

Pair programming:
Alegria Forman - navigator
Tim Forman - driver
